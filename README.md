# ARENA Web Development Challenge

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>I spend the last 2 weeks of 2024 on a challenge set by Valyfy on developing a landing page for a sports start-up called ARENA that handles sports sessions for users to book onto.</p>

<p>The web application is a full stack application that was build with Next.js as the frontend and Django as the backend, on a PostgreSQL database.</p>

<p>The user fills in a form with their details and the sports sessions he/she are interested and Stripe was used for the person to book their favourite session.</p>
